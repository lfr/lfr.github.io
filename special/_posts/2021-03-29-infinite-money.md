No click bait here, I'm really going to talk about infinite money, so buckle up and enjoy this new 2^8 special!

## Prepare to be mind blown

You make money. Your country also makes money.

For **you** making money means selling stuff, or selling labor.

For **your country**, making money means creating it out of thin air.

These two meanings of making money couldn't be more different from each other, yet this distinction largely goes unnoticed by the average citizen, and because of this, almost everyone's concept of money is a myth.

Yes, your country also sells stuff to other countries, but that's not how the money you have in mind ‚Äî the one you earn and pay your taxes in ‚Äî is made.

## But before, why money

Some people speak of money as not that important or meaningful, but those usually have enough of it to associate money with luxury.

For the vast majority of people money isn't related to luxury, it's related to food, shelter, health, and the ability to pay a couple of bills on time, some of the time.

Like everyone else you likely define money as a measure of wealth or something useful for trade, but those are just facts about money, they could just as well be used to describe gold when people carried it in pouches, yet your money and that gold are nothing alike.

## You think you're educated?

It may come as a surprise that pre-internet 19th century farmers knew a whole lot more about money then we do.

Indeed, they were the ones behind the [Greenback movement](https://youtu.be/LNSWIdIbzl8) that tried to influence monetary policy until it was dissolved in **1889**.

Today, with all the access to information in the world, almost no one cares about or indeed understands what monetary policy is, that this responsibility lies in the hands of non-elected, mostly unknown, decidedly private folks.

They, however, are not the topic of this article, the point for now is this: access to information doesn't guarantee education, but curiosity helps, so keep reading if you have it.

## Inflation, the lie that keeps on giving

Before introducing the concept of infinite money, you have to let go of what you think you know about inflation.

Inflation works exactly the way you think in a closed system, if you add more money to it and everything else stays the same, people are willing to spend more for the same thing, driving its price up.

Unfortunately, this understanding of inflation doesn't help in any way when trying to predict the consequences of money supply in the price of goods, no more than understanding how water turns to vapor in a pressure cooker helps you predict the weather.

### Unpredictability as a feature

Just like the weather, modern economy is a open [complex system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system), and anyone trying to trivialize those using a simple metaphor like the closed room above is a **charlatan**. Literally.

Once upon a time that term referred to people who tricked others into giving away their coin with the promise of predicting the weather. Complex systems can't be predicted, which is why they're great material for the disingenuous.

Because it's also an open system, nothing behaves according to intuition, and things can have exactly the opposite effect that you predict. An excellent example of this is how [adding lanes to a highway can actually increase congestion](https://www.wired.com/2014/06/wuwt-traffic-induced-demand/) when every fiber of your body makes you think more lanes = less traffic.

Be wary of anyone appealing to your intuition to explain complex systems, they're con artists, if you accept this you're ready for what you came for:

## Infinite money üí∏

A country or government can never run out of money, it can only run out of finite resources like food, oil, or fresh water, but by definition **a finite resource is not one that you can print**, let alone type into existence in a computer.

You can think of money like metric tons, the latter measures mass, the former measures value, but you can never run out of money just like you can never run out of metric tons, they are abstract ethereal concepts. 

Money feels more tangible because it exists in physical form, but don't let that fool you, coins and bills are a minuscule vestigial fraction of modern money supply, one that's been put on life support by the recent pandemic.

## One exception

For all except one country the concept of infinite money is relative, as they can still run out of foreign currency, preventing them from buying resources they may not have internally.

For the US however, the concept of infinite money is **absolute**. As the issuer of the world's reserve currency, the US can never run out of it.

This means that the US is not only the richest country on earth, it's infinitely so. It's playing the game in god mode if you will.

## The power of gods

The ability to issue the world's reserve currency is truly the power of gods, but these "gods" aren't any public institutions, they're not even necessarily all americans, and they're definitely none of the ones you've met.

In all fairness their identity is somewhat irrelevant, no one should be entrusted with this kind of power, so going over who they are to assess if they deserve it is pointless, it's not like we should give that power to someone else.

A much more interesting question that I want you to ask yourself is this: If some people have the power of gods, what are they doing with it?

I'd love to say that it's being used to cure cancer, get rid of poverty, hell even just getting rid of poverty in the US alone would be nice, and **easy**, with that kind of financial firepower.

Alas, this power is being wasted on a stupid war, a tale for another time no doubt, but it's not the point of this article, which can be found in the aptly named section below.

## The point of this article

Infinite money is **not** just a catchy concept with no ties to the practical world.

Useful policies are being discarded all the time because there's supposedly no money for them. You have to understand that at the US national level, not having money for a policy is a farce, it's smoke an mirrors, because there's **literally infinite money**.

I see I'm losing some skeptics in the audience so please read on.

### Some people ‚òù

Some people may argue that money is technically controlled by the FED, without going into the topic of central banks which is even more mind boggling than the concept of infinite money, suffice to say that (at the time of writing) the [US Mint](https://www.usmint.gov/) still exists, meaning some form of money creation is still in the hands of the people, the FED can't be used as an excuse.

### Other people üëâ

Other people may argue that when we say there's no money for X policy, it's just shorthand for the fact that there's not enough resources. There's just no evidence to back this theory, with [30% to 40% of its food production ending up in landfills](https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20food,percent%20of%20the%20food%20supply.&text=Wholesome%20food%20that%20could%20have,and%20disposing%20of%20discarded%20food.), no shortage of land, and vast strategic supplies of oil, the "no money is shorthand for no resources" theory just doesn't hold any water in the case of the US.

## Conclusion

If there's one thing I want you to take away from this article is this: at the US national level, saying that there isn't enough money for infrastructure or any other investment you can think of is nonsense.

It's not that it makes little sense, it's not that it's confusing or misleading, it's that it literally makes **zero** sense.

It's a straight up fiery pants falsehood. A classic example of made-up non-truthful **lie**. I don't know how else to put it, it's the intelligence-insulting verbal equivalent to spitting on your face, while still spitting on your face, at the same time.

From now on, whenever you hear this falsehood:

> There's not enough money to do both X and Y

In your head, I want you to hear this far more accurate statement:

> There's not enough metric tons to weigh all this bullshit that I'm about to feed you

Which is saying something, considering that like money, metric tons are also infinite.

## There's more to this story

Most people just can't wrap their head around the fact that money is infinite, which is why for now I didn't digress into any of the adjacent topics no matter how juicy. Central Banks, the "gods", that mysterious war, all great topics for future specials no doubt.

In reality the monetary system is made of two parts, a faucet and a sink. Here we briefly touched the topic of the faucet and its infinite supply, in my next special we'll go over the sink, and let me tell you that one will be a doozy, so [thank you for following me](http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=luwvis) and I'll see you at **2^9**!

## Ask me anything

If you read the whole article with an open mind, no doubt that you'll have questions, feel free to ask them on this article's thread and I'll do my best to answer if the answer is short, or possibly turn them into an if it's not.
