No click bait here, I'm really going to talk about infinite money, so buckle up and enjoy this new second ever special!

## Money money money

Some people speak of money as not that important or meaningful, but those usually have enough of it to associate money with luxury.

Truth is, for the vast majority of people money isn't related to luxury, it's related to food, shelter, health, and the ability to pay a couple of bills on time, some of the time.

Regardless of which group you're in, chances are you just see money as a measure of wealth, or as something useful for trade, but those are just facts about money, they could just as well be used to describe gold when people carried gold pouches, yet money and gold couldn't be more different.

## You think you're educated?

Access to information is at an all time high thanks to software and technology, so it may come as a surprise that pre-internet 19th century farmers knew a whole lot more about money than the average person today.

Indeed, they were the ones behind the [Greenback movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/Greenback-movement) that advocated for public control of the money hose till it was dissolved in **1889**.

Today, with all the interwebs in the world, most americans struggling to make a buck probably don't even know their currency can be summoned into existence by decidedly-non-public private actors, something I could write a whole article about.

The point for now is this: access to information doesn't guarantee education, but curiosity helps, so keep reading if you have it.

## Inflation, boooring

Before introducing the concept of infinite money, you have to let go of what you think you know about inflation.

Inflation works exactly the way you think it does in a closed system, if you add more money to it and everything else stays the same, people are willing to spend more for the same stuff driving its price up.

Unfortunately, this understanding of inflation doesn't help in any way when trying to predict the consequences of money supply in the price of goods, no more than understanding of how water turns to vapor in a pressure cooker helps you predict the weather.

Just like the weather, modern economy is a [chaotic complex system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system), and anyone trying to explain it away using a simple metaphor like the magical closed room above is a charlatan. Literally. It's someone with an agenda, trying to sell you on an idea they directly or indirectly benefit from.

If you are ready to accept inflation as no more or less predictable than the weather, read on!

## Infinite money ðŸ’¸

A country or government can never run out of money, it can only run out of finite resources like food, oil, or fresh water, but by definition a finite resource is not one that you can print, let alone type into existence in a computer.

You can think of money like metric tons, the latter measures mass, the former measures value, but you can never run out of money just like you can never run out of metric tons, they are abstract ethereal concepts. 

Money feels more tangible because it exists in physical form, but coins and bills are a minuscule vestigial fraction of modern money supply, and they'll eventually completely disappear.

## One exception

For all except one country the concept of infinite money is relative, as they can still run out of foreign currency, preventing them from buying resources they may not have internally.

For the US however, the concept of infinite money is **absolute**. As the issuer of the world's reserve currency, it can never run out of it.

This means that the US is not only the richest country on earth, it's infinitely so. It's playing the game in god mode if you will.

## The power of gods

The ability to issue the world's reserve currency is truly the power of gods, but the gods aren't necessarily all americans, and they're definitely none of the ones you've met.

In all fairness their identity is somewhat irrelevant, no one should be entrusted with this kind of power, so going over who they are to assess if they deserve it is pointless, it's not like we should replace them with anyone else.

A much more interesting question that I want you to ask yourself is this: If some people have the power of gods, what are they doing with it?

## The 1 trillion dollar question

I'd love to say that it's being used to cure cancer, get rid of poverty, hell even just getting rid of poverty in the US alone would be nice, and easy with that kind of financial firepower.

Throughout history when a group of people had extra power it was often directly or indirectly used to subjugate those who had less of it, and sadly those who wield this amazing power are no exception, they're just using it to wage a war but probably not one that you have in mind.

This modern version of *imma bash ur stone age ass with my bronze age club* is a great story in and of itself, and no doubt will be the topic of one of my future specials.

## Conclusion

Most people just can't wrap their head around the fact that money is infinite, which is why I didn't digress into any of the juicy adjacent topics.
 
Money can be scarce in a single household, but never at the US national level. There is absolutely no budgetary obstacle standing in the way of a monthly UBI for instance, and with [30% to 40% of its food production ending up in landfills](https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20food,percent%20of%20the%20food%20supply.&text=Wholesome%20food%20that%20could%20have,and%20disposing%20of%20discarded%20food.), no reason to believe that this extra income would have any impact on the price of food just to name that one example.

Ideally, the next time you hear someone say that money is finite or speculate on what may cause inflation I'd like you to look at them the same way you'd look at someone stating that daily showers have a negative impact on rainfall.

The monetary system is actually made of two parts, a faucet and a sink. Here we went over the faucet and its infinite supply, in my next special we'll go over the sink, and let me tell you that one will be a doozy, so [thank you for following me](http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=luwvis) and I'll see you at **2^8**!

<p>Silly answer: Haven't you heard about <a href="/special/2020/07/13/the-end-of-the-apolitical-dev">The End of The Apolitical Developer</a>?</p>
<p>Long answer: Developers are problem solvers, and as a humanist I see society as the ultimate problem to solve, and thus the ultimate and most rewarding challenge. There's a lot more to this but that's an article for another time!</p>
