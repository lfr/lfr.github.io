So you're a software developer and you like to code, but you also have opinions. Until fairly recently you'd feel comfortable either sharing or not sharing these, but lately you may feel that you need to share, for fear of judgement, but you may not want to share, for fear of judgement. 

It's a strange lose-lose situation when polarizing tidal forces of politics become so strong that saying something will likely get you in trouble, and not saying anything will likely get you in trouble, but you don't control human nature just like you don't control nature nature, and as strange as these tidal forces may be, they are clearly here and we now have to learn to live with them.
