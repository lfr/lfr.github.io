Sam is appalled by recent events. She wants change. She doesn't understand how so many people feel so comfortable with the status quo. She reads tweets from activists, she retweets, she educates herself, and if someone is deemed beyond the pale, she'll get them canceled. She can no longer afford to just being a developer.

Sam mostly keeps to himself. He has opinions about recent events, but doesn't feel comfortable or safe sharing them. As a developer, he feels that his contribution to the community is either writing code or writing about code, but not politics. He wants to ignore anyone who dares to suggest that his silence is complicit.

## But wait, they have the same name

Neither of them feel comfortable being just a developer right now, but these aren't regular times. Sam disapproves of Sam's twitter mob justice, and Sam disapproves of Sam's silence, but who is right?

Sam and Sam have the same name because they represent the same thing. They are individuals living in uncertain times, they both love to code but they are being pulled outside of their craft by the tidal forces of politics. I don't expect this to be self evident, but it turns out that it does not matter that they have different opinions, this is something that will hopefully become clear if you read on.

## The right thing is rarely the easiest

Casting twitter stones from the comfort of your office chair may seem like hard work, but it's definitely easier and safer than going out and do real world activism.

Staying silent in the face of racial injustice may seem a bit uncomfortable right now, but it's definitely easier than sharing your slightly nuanced opinions to an audience with no patience left for nuance.

I won't blame you for doing what's easier as opposed to what's right because I do that myself more often that not, but I will blame you for judging your fellow developer. Don't unfollow them because they're a twitter activist. Don't unfollow them because they're not. And above all else, don't unfollow your fellow developer who you respect as a developer because they have different opinions.

## Actions, not different opinions, should offend you

To illustrate this point I'm going to need a concrete example, and I'm going to use someone that I've myself felt very conflicting things about and that most people know: Elon Musk. Here's a few things that he's said and done in no particular order:

- created Tesla
- created SpaceX
- tweeted "FREE AMERICA NOW"
- tweeted "Am considering taking Tesla private at $420"
- called someone a pedo guy after they suggested he shoved a submarine where the sun doesn't shine, I'm guessing he meant London
- tweeted "Take the red pill"
- smoked weed in Joe Rogan's show

Now let's try to categorize them

| what             | action or opinion | world impact                                                 | my opinion                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tesla            | action            | pushed an entire industry to invest in cleaner tech          | thanks to this, there's still a plan A                       |
| SpaceX           | action            | undeniably inspiring in a time where such things are in short supply | thanks to this, there may be a plan B                        |
| FREE AMERICA     | opinion           | hard to assess, may have made some people comfortable with not wearing masks etc. | I agree that "America" needs to be freed yes, from that utterly corrupt two party system |
| Tesla at $420    | action            | cost him $20 million, otherwise none                         | not terribly wise, but in the scale of terrible harmful CEO behavior that goes unpunished most of the time, this doesn't even move the needle |
| pedo guy         | action            | none                                                         | you have to be either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid to publicly insult someone with 30M followers, but the fact that he got offended kinda narrows it down |
| red pill         | opinion           | none                                                         | American politics is utterly broken, until it's fixed I'm not going to ponder over anyone's political affiliation or lack thereof, and it's not even clear that this is any kind of endorsement, and if it is it's as weak as it gets |
| smoked weed live | action            | none                                                         | Bob Marley would approve                                     |
|                  |                   |                                                              |                                                              |



The line between conscionable and unconscionable is sometimes thin, but it's important. People are entitled to their opinions, even the ones every fiber of your body disagrees with, but racist behavior is not an opinion, nobody's entitled to it and it should never go unpunished.

If you're reading this and thinking there's no way I'll follow X because of what they said,

## Embrace the other side

Let yourself be exposed to the other side. It is human nature that we all have different opinions, and yes, some of those opinions may seem terrible to you. But you're not going to wish human nature away by confining yourself in your own echo chamber.



So you're a software developer and you like to code, but you also have opinions. Until fairly recently you'd feel comfortable either sharing or not sharing these, but lately you may feel that you need to share, for fear of judgement, but you may not want to share, for fear of judgement. 

It's a strange lose-lose situation when polarizing tidal forces of politics become so strong that saying something will likely get you in trouble, and not saying anything will likely get you in trouble, but you don't control human nature just like you don't control nature nature, and as strange as these tidal forces may be, they are clearly here and we now have to learn to live with them.

## Neutrality

As a swiss citizen I know a thing or two about neutrality.

## Going beyond opinions
