C# developer since 2004, and F# developer since 2018, this blog chronicles my journey to functional wonderland.

Whether you want to make that journey with me or just watch the few highs and the many lows from the comfort of your armchair, follow me on Twitter for the latest updates.

Functional Programming may seem like a scary topic, and in some ways it can be, but you don't have to make that journey alone.

As the saying goes, alone you'll go faster, but together we'll go further, or `A ∪ B > A ∧ B`. Just kidding, please come back.

Using the link below you can help me spend more time keeping this blog & projects I maintain both free and free of crappy content, needless to say I'd be eternally<sup>*</sup> grateful:
