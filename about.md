There's not much to say about me, I'm a dad, twice, husband, and developer at CBS Interactive Inc. I'd describe myself as a full stack developer, but who wouldn't these days, and I specialize in API dev. I haven't written any books, nor have I hosted any talks, so if you're asking yourself how you ended up here, worry not, I'm asking myself the same thing.
