In the image above you can see the effect of my last two posts on the blog's traffic. If you look at number of visits (<span style="color:#3a8fc4">in blue</span>), clearly my article [Take F# to the stars](https://functionalfunsies.com/fun/2020/06/30/take-it-to-the-stars/) was â€” please forgive me â€” a stellar hit. If you look at average time spent (<span style="color:#b3e0f2">also in blue</span>), my most recent article [The last apolitical developer](https://functionalfunsies.com/special/2020/07/13/the-end-of-the-apolitical-dev/) did much better. In fact it over performed all my articles by a factor of 10.

## Audience vs. attention

This is not the first time I ponder on the importance of users vs. time. My main venues for passive entertainment are YouTube and Netflix, and they have been for a long time.

Netflix has always used time as their main metric, its purpose is to maximize their subscribers time spent on the platform. I remember one of Reed Hastings' earlier interviews where he shared this fact, adding that because of this their main competition was gaming, and that the future of entertainment may be an hallucinogenic pill ðŸ¤¯

YouTube also transitioned to time spent optimization at some point, and I clearly remember youtubers sharing in their videos the fact that the monetization algorithm was successfully incentivizing them to make longer videos. Earlier YouTube videos were usually around 5 minutes, and after this the 10 minute format became more of a norm.

Obviously both number of users and average time spent go hand in hand, but before these peaks into this industry's ways I personally always considered audience size as the only metric that mattered.

## Back to my blog

So you may be wondering what do I personally think of the performances of both articles. At the risk of disappointing you, I don't think that much one way or another. As a brand new blog, I clearly need new eyeballs, so an article that spreads like wildfire is very welcome.

As a writer however I care less about how many people I reach and more about whether the people that landed here found something of value and ended up reading most of the article. In this respect the performance of [The last apolitical developer](https://functionalfunsies.com/special/2020/07/13/the-end-of-the-apolitical-dev/) is particularly rewarding. It may have reached a fraction of my most popular article, but for that fraction, and for those 10 minutes or less, it gave Netflix a run for its money.

No hard feelings Reed, I'm still a huge fan, just don't send me any pills.
