        As a swiss I can say that neutrality is anything but apolitical, it's a very clear stance, one that has torn swiss internal politics apart on more than one occasion. Little known fact: Switzerland didn't decide to be neutral for the comfort of not picking sides. The swiss used to be great warriors and not shy away from using that prowess for territorial gain, and it's only after a humiliating slaughter while invading another country that the decision was taken to become neutral forever. We became neutral because we didn't trust ourselves to not use our skills for evil. Neutrality came from blood, not peace.
