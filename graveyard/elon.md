To illustrate this point I'm going to need a concrete example, and I'm going to use someone that I've myself had conflicting thoughts about and that most people know: Elon Musk. Here's a few things that he's said and done in no particular order:

- created Tesla
- created SpaceX
- tweeted "FREE AMERICA NOW"
- tweeted "Am considering taking Tesla private at $420"
- called someone a pedo guy after they suggested he shoved a submarine where the sun doesn't shine, I'm guessing he meant London
- tweeted "Take the red pill"
- smoked weed in Joe Rogan's show

Now let's try to categorize them:

| what             | action or opinion | why it matters                                               | my opinion                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tesla            | action            | pushed an entire industry to invest in cleaner tech          | thanks to this, there's still a plan A                       |
| SpaceX           | action            | undeniably inspiring in a time where such things are in short supply | thanks to this, there may be a plan B                        |
| FREE AMERICA     | opinion           | it doesn't                                                   | I agree that "America" needs to be freed yes, from that disastrous two-party system |
| Tesla at $420    | action            | cost him $20 million                                         | not terribly wise, but in the scale of terrible harmful CEO behavior that goes unpunished, this isn't even a bleep in the radar |
| pedo guy         | action            | it doesn't                                                   | you have to be either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid to publicly insult someone with 30M followers, but the fact that he got offended kinda narrows it down |
| red pill         | opinion           | it doesn't                                                   | American politics is so broken, I think it's completely futile to until it's fixed I'm not going to ponder over anyone's political affiliation or lack thereof and tbh this just sounds like trolling |
| smoked weed live | action            | it doesn't                                                   | Bob Marley would approve                                     |
