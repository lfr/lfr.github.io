Have you ever found yourself perusing fsharpforfunandprofit's excelent [Designing With Types](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/series/designing-with-types.html) series, and said to yourself: _man, those single case unions are sweet_?

Have you ever then found yourself digging a little deeper only to realize you'd need a type declaration like this, for every... single... type?

```fsharp
// Code by Scott Wlaschin â€” fsharpforfunandprofit.com

/// Type with constraint that value must be non-null
/// and <= 50 chars.
type String50 = private String50 of string

/// Module containing functions related to String50 type
module String50 =

    // NOTE: these functions can access the internals of the
    // type because they are in the same scope (namespace/module)

    /// constructor
    let create str = 
        if String.IsNullOrEmpty(str) then
            None
        elif String.length str > 50 then
            None
        else
            Some (String50 str)

    // function used to extract data since type is private
    let value (String50 str) = str
```
If this sounds familiar, perhaps like me you've decided to still use the method above because the advantages of coding against types guaranteed to be valid outweights the inconvenince of creating the type/module combinations above.

And maybe, just maybe, perhaps like me you've
