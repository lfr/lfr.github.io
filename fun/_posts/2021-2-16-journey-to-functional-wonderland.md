Wandering developer, your next adventure awaits, and I know you're ready because you've been ready since you wrote your 1ˢᵗ line of code.

This journey will bring you fame of course, and glory, sooo much glory. But above all else, this journey will take you to a lost magical place where the code you write somehow speaks to you like a great melody that sounds familiar even as you listen to it for the first time.

It's ok for you to be skeptical, as a fellow developer it's likely that your only goal is to create code that works. See this journey as a shortcut that will dramatically reduce the times you create code that doesn't.

## Do not postpone this journey

Many have put it off in a futile attempt to master their craft first. Do not make this mistake, this journey requires no credentials or any academic recognition of your readiness.

Do not ask for permission.

All you need is the love of your craft that took you here, and the inquisitive open mind of someone for whom no leap is too far to reach truer grounds.

## Do not mistake this journey for what it's not

The path ahead is not about learning an alternative way of doing the same thing, this would not be a good use of your time. Rather, this journey is about recognizing **how misguided some of the concepts we've held true have always been**.

Going from the comfort of what you already know to the discomfort of what you don't even realize you don't know requires curiosity, but it will also require courage.

## There is no courage without fear

Perhaps you don't see a lot of risk in your craft, and yet, there's no shortage of fear around when it comes to investing one's precious time learning something before even being capable of understanding its purpose.

Your fear is justified. Your time, and even more so your mental energy is very precious. Accept that fear, embrace it even, for ***it*** is the proof that it was courage, not chance, that set you off on this journey.

## The first step is the hardest

Even if it seems like dark magic, trust me that you'll very soon learn the basic spells, and by then you will already be a much better wizard. It's true that Functional Wonderland is vast and full of mysteries, but you don't have to venture deep to reap the rewards, in fact you'll get most of the value just from skirting its shores, and trust me, you will not be doing it alone.

Indeed, you will not be the first **object oriented programmer** to set sail, neither will you be the last, but for all that attempted this perilous but infinitely rewarding journey it always started in the same familiar place.

## The journey continues ⛵
