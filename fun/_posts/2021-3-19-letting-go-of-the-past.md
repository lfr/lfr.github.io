Ever caught yourself spending an unreasonable amount of time thinking about how to name something, or pondering over architectural concerns that you couldn't care less about, out of fear some choices may come back to haunt you?

As stated in the introduction to the series, most devs just care about writing simple code that works, but it's surprisingly easy to stray from that goal without even noticing it.

You've been creating and using functions your whole developer life, but if functions aren't exclusive to Functional Programming, what makes it functional?

## Let's start with the 'Programming' part

You can boil down programming to modeling real world problems, along with some solutions. As the statistician George Box said: all models are wrong but some are useful.

If programming is modelling, and all models are wrong, one can safely define programming as the quest for the simplest most useful model to solve a real world problem.

The real world is seemingly made of objects for the most part, so one can understand how appealing Object Oriented Programming may have been when it first introduced the glorious object as the basic building block of a whole new programming paradigm.

## A critical mind challenges everything

Let's get back to the premise that makes OOP so appealing, the fact that the real world is mostly made of objects.

Can you think of anything that's not an object?

Here's a handful of things that aren't objects:

- Energy
- Time
- Money (except bills & coins which are a tiny fraction of modern money)
- Social media attention & engagement
- Data
  
Do you notice a pattern? Far from insignificant, things that aren't objects are usually the very real world problems that programming ultimately tries to solve for.

Objects are just a metaphor, an abstraction in your model meant to represent something concrete in the real world problem you're trying to solve for.

But if the most important things in the real world aren't objects at all, we may have been using the wrong metaphor, and like using the wrong tool for the job, it can still get the job done but in a highly inefficient time consuming manner.

## Everything is transformed

Function: the bestest building block

There's a sereney fractal like harmony to using functions as your building block, because both your building block and your solution are a function




[solution IO] → [solution (f → f → f)] → [solution IO]
