## F#: Nimble isn't optional

For all the inconveniences that stem from F# being a <s>small</s> growing community, one huge advantage we have is being nimble. It allows for the language to evolve at a faster pace, which isn't just a luxury, it's a necessity.

Few devs are willing to forego a super-mainstream programming language for one with less adoption, even when it is (in this one man's opinion) decidedly better, so imagine if F# were *only* marginally better, it literally wouldn't exist outside academic circles.

This of course is both a blessing as a curse, as maintainers we certainly prefer when things require less maintenance. But we must not seek to settle, being a faster moving target than both .NET and C# is the only way we're going to thrive.

## When life gives you lemons üçã

Within a couple of weeks it was suggested to me that I should rename the library **and** brought to my attention that `Block`, the main module of `FSharp.ValidationBlocks`, was going to be "assimilated".

I had no plans to start 2021 making lemonade, after all I had plenty leftover from 2020, but here we are, rapid fire style:

- Both Fable and non-Fable libs now both share the same namespaces üòé
- `Block` has been deprecated in favor of `Box` üì¶
- `FSharp.ValidationBlocks` has been replaced with `FSharp.Domain.Validation`
- All your **<u>existing code remains valid</u>**, with deprecation warnings üéâ
- There's a [new repo](https://github.com/lfr/FSharp.Domain.Validation) for you to hopefully star ‚≠ê
- New [standard](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Domain.Validation/0.9.78-rc2) and [Fable](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Domain.Validation.Fable/0.9.78-rc2) release candidate packages for you to test üß™
- RC packages are .NET 5 but I can go back to netstandard 2.1 if you voice your need soon ‚ö†

## Last but not least

New branding, because we all know free libraries still need to sell, so I hope you like it!
