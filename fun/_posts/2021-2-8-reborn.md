## F#: Nimble isn't optional

For all the inconveniences that stem from F# being a <s>small</s> growing community, one huge advantage we have is being nimble. It allows for the language to evolve at a faster pace, which isn't just a luxury, it's a necessity.

Few devs are willing to forego a super-mainstream programming language for one with far less adoption, even when decidedly better in this one man's opinion, so imagine if F# were *only* marginally better, chances are that it wouldn't exist outside academic papers.

This of course is both a blessing as a curse, as maintainers we certainly prefer when things require less maintenance. But we must not seek to settle, if F# itself had settled at any given point, in all likelihood it wouldn't have seemed so innovative to anyone trying it since. Innovation can never be taken for granted.

## When life gives you lemons üçã

Within a couple of weeks it was suggested to me that I should rename the library **and** brought to my attention that `Block`, the main module of `FSharp.ValidationBlocks`, was going to be "assimilated".

I had no plans to start 2021 making lemonade, after all I had plenty leftover from 2020, but a dev of a language that must be a faster moving target than both .NET and C#, deep down I know I have to stay nimble.

So here we are, `ValidationBlocks` is no more, `Block` is gone, but there's also some good that came with the different, at least for Fable users:

- Both Fable and non-Fable libs now share the same namespaces üòé
- `Block` has been deprecated in favor of `Box` üì¶
- `FSharp.ValidationBlocks` has been replaced with `FSharp.Domain.Validation` üéä
- All your **<u>existing code remains valid</u>**, with deprecation warnings ‚ö†
- There's a [new repo](https://github.com/lfr/FSharp.Domain.Validation) for you to hopefully star ‚≠ê
- New [standard](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Domain.Validation/0.9.78-rc2) and [Fable](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Domain.Validation.Fable/0.9.78-rc2) release candidate packages for you to test üß™

Note that RC packages are .NET 5.

## Last but not least

New branding, because we all know free libraries still need to sell, so I hope you like it!
